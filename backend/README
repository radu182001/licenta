#First week
Added register and authentication endpoints. I hash the password using bcrypt, I validate the body data using Joi, I create the jwt using jsonwebtoken and I use env variables using the config module.
I also implemented the authorization middleware. It reads the token from the header and if it is valid, it sends it to the request body.
